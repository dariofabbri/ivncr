In order to avoid submitted empty fields serialized to the database as 
empty strings (instead of nulls) it is necessary to start Tomcat VM with 
the following parameter:

-Dorg.apache.el.parser.COERCE_TO_ZERO=false


The logback configuration need to be modified so to have log redirected to 
files. The audit trail need to be written on a different file.
A daily rolling file policy need to be specified.


Before moving to production set javax.faces.PROJECT_STAGE parameter to production in web.xml file.
